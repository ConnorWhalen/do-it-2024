# Installation

I recommend setting up a virtual environment to keep a separate python instance and any libraries local to this project:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv do-it-2024

# Activate virtualenv
source do-it-2024/bin/activate

# To deactivate
deactivate
```

Install [pyo](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo)

```bash
pip install pyo
```

I had to install portmidi. Clone the repo and follow the installation steps:
